# SexSpecificCognitivePredictions

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook based implementation of the work described in: Dhamala E, Jamison KW, Jaywant A, Kuceyeski A. (2020). Integrating multimodal connectivity improves prediction of individual cognitive abilities.

Keywords: neuroimaging, connectomics, machine learning, functional connectivity, structural connectivity, crystallised cognition, fluid cognition, cognition, prediction

This implementation uses functional connectivity data to predict cognitive scores using sex-independent and sex-specific prediction models.

Description of files:
01_sexindependent_and_sexspecific_predictions.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook to optimise and run sex-independent and sex-specific models
02_generate_empirical_nulls.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook to generate empirical null models
03_evaluate_model_performance.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook to evaluate whether models are significantly better than the null models, and to evaluate whether are significantly different from one another in their prediction accuracy
